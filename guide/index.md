#### Indexing

Indexing means adding a document to the search engine making it available for searching. All documents have an id
and that can be specified by you or generated by elasticsearch.

Lets index a very simple document that has a single field, a name.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
    "head" -> "tony"
}
```

Very SQL like as you can see. We can also specify the id.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
    "boss" -> "tony"
} id 1234
```

The id can be any object, it will be converted to a string using toString().
Multiple fields? Easy.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
    "boss" -> "tony",
    "consigliere" -> "salvidor",
    "underboss" -> "bobby"
} id 1234
```

If we have a nested structure, we can specifiy nested fields using dot notation.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
    "boss" -> "tony",
    "boss.age" -> "56"
}
```
