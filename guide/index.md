## Indexing

Indexing means adding a document to the search engine making it available for searching. All documents have an id
and that can be specified by you or generated by Elasticsearch.

Lets index a very simple document that has a single field, a name.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
  "head" -> "tony"
}
```

Very SQL like as you can see. We can also specify the id.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields {
  "boss" -> "tony"
} id 1234
```

The id can be any object, it will be converted to a string using toString().
Multiple fields? Easy.

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields (
  "boss" -> "tony",
  "consigliere" -> "silvio",
  "underboss" -> "bobby"
) id 1234
```

If we have a nested structure, we can specifiy nested fields using nested `Map`s:

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields (
  "boss" -> Map(
    "name" -> "tony",
    "age" -> "56"
  )
)
```

Similarly arrays can be specified using `Array`s or `Seq`s:

```scala
index into "family" -> "soprano" fields (
  "boss" -> "tony",
  "members" -> Array(
    "tony",
    "salvidor",
    "bobby"
  ),
  "crews" -> Seq(
    "gualtieri",
    "baccalieri",
    "barese",
    "moltisanti"
  )
)
```
